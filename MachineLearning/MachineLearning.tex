\begin{define}(Machine Learning)
    A computer program is said to \textbf{learn} from experience $E$ with respect to task $T$ as measured by $P$, if its performance on $T$,
    as measured by $P$, improves with experience $E$.

Traditionally, machine learning can be divided into two major categories: \textbf{supervised learning} and \textbf{unsupervised learning}. These two concepts are defined as follows:
if the input \textit{X} and label \textit{Y} are given to let the machine learn the mapping from \textit{X} to \textit{Y}, this process is called \textbf{supervised learning}. When
\textit{Y} is continuous, this problem is called a \textbf{regression} problem; when \textit{Y} is discrete, it is called a \textbf{classification} problem. If only the input \textit{X}
is given and the machine constructs a mapping which reveal the ``interesting'' stucture of $X$, then such process is called \textbf{unsupervised learning}.

Nowadays, machine learning has fairly wide applications. That makes many specific subjects contained in Machine Learning. Such as Deep Learning, Reinforced Learning, etc.
