\begin{define}[Exponential family]
    We say that a class of distributions in exponential family if its pdf can be wriiten in the form
    \[p(y:\eta)=b(y)e^{\eta^TT(y)-a(\eta)}\]
\end{define}
Here, $\eta$ is called \textbf{canonical~parameter}, $T(y)$ is the \textbf{sufficient statistic} of $y$. And $a(\eta)$ is the \textbf{log partition function}, which essentially plays a role of a 
normalization constant.
