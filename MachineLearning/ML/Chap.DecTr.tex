\chapter{Decision Tree}

\begin{define}[decision tree]
    The \textbf{decision tree model} is a tree-shaped structure that illustrates the classification rule. 
\end{define}
Decision tree is composed of node and directed edge. And the nodes can be catagorized as two type of nodes, internal node and leaf node. We ususally use internal node to represent features and leaf node
to mark a class. 

Since decision tree stands for complex classification rule, we could regard it as a set of ``if-then'' rules attached with conditional possibilities. However, it is unneccessary to put too much 
``if-then'' rules into the set for the loss of generalized ability. So we should take the most significant feature as our calssification standard.
